  abstract = {Residence-time-distribution (RTD)-based models are key to understanding the mixing dynamics of continuous manufacturing systems. Such models can allow for material traceability throughout the process and can provide the ability for removal of non-conforming material from the finished product. These models have been implemented in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing mainly for monitoring purposes, not as an integral part of the control strategy and in-process specifications. This paper discusses the steps taken to develop an RTD model design space and how the model was statistically incorporated into the product's control strategy. To develop the model, experiments were conducted at a range of blender impeller speeds and total system mass flow rates. RTD parameters were optimized for each condition tested using a tank-in-series-type model with a delay. Using the experimental RTD parameters, an equation was derived relating the mean residence time to the operating conditions (i.e., blender impeller speed and mass flow rate). The RTD parameters were used in combination with real-time upstream process data to predict downstream API concentration, where these predictions allowed validation across the entire operating range of the process by comparison to measured tablet assay. The standard in-process control limits for the product were statistically tightened using the validation acceptance criteria. Ultimately, this model and strategy were accepted by regulatory authorities.},

  abstract = {Residence time distribution (RTD) models are essential to understand process dynamics and support process monitoring and control in continuous manufacturing systems. RTD models can also be used to monitor material traceability and to isolate intermediate materials or finished products when specifications are not met. However, while pharmaceutical companies are currently making extensive use of RTD approaches, standard methods for conducting, interpreting, and using RTD results in continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing have not yet been established by regulatory authorities. This paper seeks to facilitate generating such standards. We discuss in detail the assumptions and conditions that are relevant to the proper selection of tracers for RTD experiments, and demonstrate that tracer selection can have substantial impact on RTD results. We selected seven materials with a wide range of properties as tracers and a single material as our base ``blend''. The experimental results led to two major conclusions: (1) materials with different mechanical properties have dissimilar mean residence times (MRT) inside the systems and (2) blend ingredients with different mechanical properties travel at different speed inside of continuous blending systems. Results further indicated there were two critical mean residence times (MRTs): that of the tracer and that of the bulk. Matching of material properties between tracers is key in order to obtain similar MRTs using a given tracer. Differences between selected tracer and bulk material properties were found to lead to differences between the bulk space time and the tracer MRT. A set of recommendations on how to select tracer materials that would help characterize accurately the RTD of a continuous flow system are presented.},

  abstract = {Residence time distribution (RTD) modeling can aid the understanding and characterization of macro-mixing in continuous powder processing unit operations by relating observed behavior to quantitative model parameters. This article is the second part of the work done to characterize the effect of material properties on the measurement of RTDs in continuous powder processing operations. The goal of this paper is to examine the behavior of the RTD given different sets of tracer material properties. Tracer addition methods are discussed within the framework of their mathematical representation. The two most widely used RTD models in powder systems in the literature, the axial dispersion and the tank-in-series model, are presented and used to describe the experimental data. The RTD model parameters (e.g., Pecl{\'e}t number, number of tanks in series, and residence times) were regressed from the experimental data and compared using one-way ANOVA to determine the effects of materials properties on RTD. A model independent approach using a Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was also applied to compare the results with the model dependent method. Lastly, examples of how the RTD models can aid process design and understanding were described using both continuous and discrete convolution. The RTD models and their regressed coefficients were used to predict the mixing outputs of a semi-random input and the impact of disturbances on the process.},

  abstract = {A dynamic model of a continuous direct compression process for pharmaceutical tablets is presented. The objective is to assess the impact of the variability from the feeder system on the concentration of drug in the powder in the feed frame of a tablet press. The model is based on principles of dispersed flow from the reaction engineering field. An estimability analysis was performed to understand the impact of the available measurements on the estimated parameters and suggest better ways to approach the parametrization. Predictions are successfully contrasted with experimental data. The model is used to produce residence time distributions at different process conditions and a graphical representation of the allowable range of disturbances in the feeders that can be mitigated by the process. The model was used in support of the method development for an online near infrared sensor. {\copyright} 2017 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 64: 511--525, 2018},
